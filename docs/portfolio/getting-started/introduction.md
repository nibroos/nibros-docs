# Introduction

::: info
The documentation is still under development. Most of the content is API Endpoint documentation. I will add more content about the backend and frontend implementation in the future.

If you want to see how I implement features, you can use the search bar or `Ctrl + K` then type Implementation, it will show you all the implementation content.

## What is Portfolio Nibros?

Portfolio Nibros is a Single Page Application (SPA) that showcases my past and current work, the result of almost **2 years** of being a **Fullstack Developer**. It's all about turning client needs into products.
