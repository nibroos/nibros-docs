# About

### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Nibros Ari Wibowo** as A Fullstack Developer currently working at PT Yubi Technology, Im proudly to present my projects that I've been working on.

This documentation showcases my past and current work, the result of almost **2 years** of being a **Fullstack Developer**. It's all about turning client needs into products.

Carrying **product-owning** mentality that makes me think about the product as a whole, not just the code.

In this period, I've learned and adapted as a developer. These projects are the practical results of that learning. They involve creating APIs, building strong secured back-end systems, and seamlessly implementing the front-end.

Featured projects include D-ERP System, E-SPBU Management, E-Learning, SIM-RS, Koperasi Multiasa, and Portfolio Nibros, Each one is a result of my considerations to meet and exceed client expectations.

This documentation provides insights into the strategies, challenges, and solutions that go into turning concepts into web solutions. Whether you're a fellow developer looking for insights or someone curious about the process, you're welcome to explore what's here
